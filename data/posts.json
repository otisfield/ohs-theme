The barn is a wonder of construction; it was built by Nathan Nutting Jr. around 1820-30 (Hubka). Different accounts, including Hubka&#8217;s work, indicate Nathan Nutting Jr. apprenticed as a carpenter in Boston, returning home to Otisfield as a professional carpenter in 1825 when he was just 21 years old. In a decade or so, in 1839, he would be known as a &#8220;master builder,&#8221; designing Otisfield&#8217;s Bell Hill Meetinghouse, as well as churches in Casco and Westbrook. He also made wooden carpenters planes which he marketed.<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #222222;\"><span style=\"font-family:Georgia, Serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">From the perspective of a barn researcher, and what I like to call &#8220;barnology,&#8221; perhaps the most important observation within the Nutting Barn is the evidence of what is called the &#8220;square rule&#8221; method of construction. Unlike its older counterpart the &#8220;scribe rule,&#8221; where a barn&#8217;s frame will display Roman numerals at prominent joint locations, there are no observable carpenter&#8217;s marks on the\u00a0Nutting Barn&#8217;s frame. The young Nutting likely learned of the newer layout and construction method while apprenticing in Boston.\u00a0<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #222222;\"><span style=\"font-family:Georgia, Serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">The square rule works on the premise of interchangeable parts, a facet that found its way into nearly every industry in the 19th century. The concept was difficult for carpenters to envision before this, as many if not all worked with the uneven nature of hand-hewn timber in building projects. For centuries, a builder had to custom fit every piece in a timber frame. The square rule works on the premise that even though rough timbers that vary in cross-section are employed, perfectly square and true beams, only slightly smaller, exist within. The carpenter might be using 8 x 8-inch timbers, but would frame the building to the smaller so-called &#8220;perfect timber within,&#8221; which the carpenter might determine as 7 x 7 inches.<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #222222;\"><span style=\"font-family:Georgia, Serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">The evidence of this is seen in the Nutting Barn. Shallow housings have been made in the timbers where they intersect, esp. where braces and the tops of posts join with tie beams. In other words, these connections are not always &#8220;flush&#8221; with one another but are housed below the surface of the timber a bit.\u00a0<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #222222;\">\u00a0<span style=\"font-family:Georgia, Serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">For more on the square rule technique and its history, see <\/span><\/span><\/span><span style=\"color: #222222;\"><span style=\"font-family:Georgia, Serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"><u>The Barns of Maine<\/u><\/span><\/span><\/span><span style=\"color: #222222;\"><span style=\"font-family:Georgia, Serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">, pages 45 &amp; 158.<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #222222;\"><span style=\"font-family:Georgia, Serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">As was previously mentioned, the Nutting Barn is a bit unusual in that it displays a roof system where the boarding is affixed horizontally. Hubka also notes this in his work.\u00a0All other barns visited this day display vertical roof boarding. The whole roof, indeed the entire structure is exceedingly well-built, perhaps even overbuilt. Bracing is numerous and complex. A &#8220;five-sided ridge beam&#8221; graces the peak. Hewing a ridge timber such as this into a pentagon shape took skill. These ridge beams were devised so certain faces of the beam\u00a0would meet rafters at right angles. This helped facilitate joint layout and measurements.<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #222222;\"><span style=\"font-family:Georgia, Serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">Posts are set on 10-foot spacings, a fairly close distance. This along with extra bracing has no doubt helped the barn maintain its longevity. The tie beams, which reach across the building from eaves to eaves, are continuous hewn timbers spanning some 40 feet. Floorboards on the main aisle are held fast not by nails but with square, wooden pegs, an early detail seen in other barns of this area and period.<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #222222;\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #222222;\"><span style=\"font-family:Georgia, Serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">Another interesting detail is the presence of an interior silo, which was constructed with a plaster and lath interior in order to ensure the vessel&#8217;s silage remained somewhat airtight. It also frustrated hungry rodents from stealing the contents. According to Clarence Day&#8217;s work\u00a0<\/span><\/span><\/span><span style=\"color: #222222;\"><span style=\"font-family:Georgia, Serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"><u>Farming in Maine<\/u><\/span><\/span><\/span><span style=\"color: #222222;\"><span style=\"font-family:Georgia, Serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">, there were no silos before 1870 among Maine&#8217;s barns. As such, we can determine the silo came some 40-50 years into this barn&#8217;s life. The first silos were interior and square, and they often could not hold the weight of tons of grain. Many early silos blew out under pressure. Hooped, round silos were soon found to be far stronger.<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #222222;\"><span style=\"font-family:Georgia, Serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">This barn has been vacant for decades if not longer. Vegetation has all but overtaken its exterior on three sides. This can be problematic since moisture, especially along the lower walls, will not always dry between rains. Moreover, as trees grow bigger, the branches blow and begin tearing at siding and roofing, letting damaging moisture into the structure. It would be beneficial to have the growth around the building reduced so this important and celebrated barn, whose builder, a &#8220;master carpenter,&#8221;\u00a0is documented,\u00a0can remain for future generations to study and appreciate.<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p align=\"CENTER\"><span style=\"color: #222222;\"><span style=\"font-family:Georgia, Serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"><b>Barn #2: Winslow Barn<\/b><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p align=\"CENTER\"><span style=\"color: #222222;\"><span style=\"font-family:Georgia, Serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">(no photo)<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #222222;\"><span style=\"font-family:Georgia, Serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">This detached building was thought to be two barns that were previously hauled together. What was discovered instead was a small barn that had been added on to, essentially doubling its size. There is a hand-hewn frame throughout. The original part is likely the part furthest from the house. This was determined by the presence of hewn bracing in that section, while the part closer to the house has sawn bracing and later-era circular-sawn roof boards.<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #222222;\"><span style=\"font-family:Georgia, Serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">The building is more in keeping with a common farmer&#8217;s building than\u00a0one built by an apprenticed carpenter. It&#8217;s roof is fairly steep, steeper than most early barns in town. This may place it at a later time period. The earlier section of the building&#8217;s frame has a continuous top plate, while the other section has what&#8217;s referred to as a &#8220;connected girt&#8221; system where posts are connected via segmented girts\u00a0instead of\u00a0a top plate. While the English tying joint is from Europe, the connected girt configuration is wholly American in origin.\u00a0For a visual diagram of these distinct construction styles, see\u00a0<\/span><\/span><\/span><span style=\"color: #222222;\"><span style=\"font-family:Georgia, Serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"><u>The Barns of Maine<\/u><\/span><\/span><\/span><span style=\"color: #222222;\"><span style=\"font-family: Georgia, Serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">, page 186.<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #222222;\"><span style=\"font-family:Georgia, Serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">An interesting detail in the &#8220;newer&#8221; portion can be seen in how the rafters are attached to the tie beams. Large &#8220;trunnels&#8221; or &#8220;tree nails&#8221; (oversized pegs)\u00a0are spiked clear through this connection.

It looks like the building was joined to the house at some point as newer siding and roofing\u00a0cover only partial surfaces that face the house. This was the only such English barn in town visited, and\u00a0since it is the earlier style (preceding the New England or Yankee barn), it may be one of the oldest barns left in town. Foremost among these indicators are a hand-hewn frame with English tying joints. Roman numerals can be seen at some major in joint intersections indicating the earlier &#8220;square rule&#8221; technique.\u00a0Per the owner&#8217;s request (as well as absence), a detailed inspection of the interior was not possible.<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #222222;\"><span style=\"font-family:Georgia, Serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">The English tying joint configuration refers to the exterior post&#8217;s top area where roof rafter, wall plate and tie beam intersect. It is a medieval construction style from 13th-century England that was used for over 500 years among those of English descent. For more on the English tying joint and its half-millennia of unbroken history, see\u00a0<\/span><\/span><\/span><span style=\"color: #222222;\"><span style=\"font-family:Georgia, Serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"><u>The Barns of Maine<\/u><\/span><\/span><\/span><span style=\"color: #222222;\"><span style=\"font-family:Georgia, Serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">, pages 18-20.<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #222222;\"><span style=\"font-family:Georgia, Serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">Today, this barn is noticeably racked and listing; this is because much of the barn&#8217;s bracing was removed at some point. This short-sighted alteration was likely done to create more usable interior space.\u00a0Whoever did this, however, did the building a disservice by failing to appreciate the importance of bracing in a timber frame building.<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #222222;\"><span style=\"font-family:Georgia, Serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">An interesting detail on this barn, and at least one other visited this day, was the presence of 3-foot-long clapboards over one entire\u00a0gable end wall. Every clapboard was 3 feet long. These could have been remnants and therefore cheaper to purchase, or a sawmill in the area might have had an early machine capable of sawing clapboards only from small &#8220;bolts&#8221; of timber. Early clapboards were sometimes split or riven and not sawn. It could not be determined with any certainty the age of these clapboards and whether they were sawn or split.<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #222222;\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p align=\"CENTER\"><span style=\"color: #222222;\"><span style=\"font-family:Georgia, Serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"><b>Barn 4: Haggerty Barn<\/b><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p align=\"CENTER\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.otisfield.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/image04.png\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-422\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-422\" src=\"http:\/\/www.otisfield.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/image04-225x300.png\" alt=\" Haggerty Barn\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"http:\/\/www.otisfield.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/image04-225x300.png 225w, http:\/\/www.otisfield.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/image04.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #222222;\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #222222;\"><span style=\"font-family:Georgia, Serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">Covering this barn&#8217;s front wall, at the entrance, the same 3-foot-long clapboards\u00a0found on\u00a0Barn # 3 were encountered. This attached\u00a0barn is not very deep, only two bays in length; just three bents make up the structure. Upon walking around the building&#8217;s exterior a few yards from the back of the building, just at the surface, a few rocks\u00a0were discovered. One of these is in the exact plane as one of the barn&#8217;s eaves walls indicating it could define the building&#8217;s original footprint. However, it may also be ledge.\u00a0Some faded white-washing in the interior still remains and\u00a0testifies to the original cattle tie-up section. On the other side of the barn, the floorboards are attached with square pegs, an early detail also found at the floor of the Nutting Barn.<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p align=\"CENTER\"><span style=\"color: #222222;\"><span style=\"font-family:Georgia, Serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"><b>Barn 5: Wight Barn<\/b><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p align=\"CENTER\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.otisfield.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/image07.png\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-425\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-425\" src=\"http:\/\/www.otisfield.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/image07-300x225.png\" alt=\"Wight Barn\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" srcset=\"http:\/\/www.otisfield.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/image07-300x225.png 300w, http:\/\/www.otisfield.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/image07-768x576.png 768w, http:\/\/www.otisfield.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/image07.png 800w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #222222;\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #222222;\"><span style=\"font-family:Georgia, Serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">This freestanding barn is unique in that it preserves an original detail: it may have never ever\u00a0been sided. Vertical, weathered boards grace the walls today. Early barns were often not sided since nails were expensive; this outlay was typically saved for homes rather than outbuildings. Economy is precisely why the boarding on early barns was affixed vertically since this naturally sheds water better than horizontal boarding.<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #222222;\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #222222;\"><span style=\"font-family:Georgia, Serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">The building&#8217;s frame is a hybrid of sawn and hewn material. The longer members (rafters and tie beams)\u00a0are hewn, while the posts, bracing and wall girts are sawn material. Early sawmills often could not saw stock over 24 feet in length. If a carpenter wanted the strength of unbroken timber\u00a0for long frame pieces (a wise choice), he simply\u00a0choose to hand hew these pieces to any length he needed. This will often explain the miscellany of stock types in a building. Of note are the unbroken 40-foot tie beams that transversely span the barn. At 8 inches square, these required several\u00a0large, straight trees.<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #222222;\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #222222;\"><span style=\"font-family:Georgia, Serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">The frame is not one of English tying joints with a continuous top wall plate, but rather\u00a0of &#8220;connected girt&#8221; construction. See Barn # 2 above. Also of note,\u00a0appears to be the presence of &#8220;square rule&#8221; layout and construction. No carpenter&#8217;s marks or numerals are visible. For more on square rule see Nutting Barn, above.<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #222222;\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #222222;\"><span style=\"font-family:Georgia, Serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">The door and main aisle of this barn are offset; these are common features in pre-Civil War barns of the area. The offset is always to the &#8220;sunny side,&#8221; that is, the narrow section will be where livestock were kept. This was oriented to take advantage of\u00a0precious winter sunlight.\u00a0The wider section will be on the cooler, usually north, side, and was the haymow where hay\u00a0was stored. The length of livestock plus a couple feet for the farmer to walk behind typically determined post layout in a barn. This ultimately determined the aisle and\u00a0door location within the building&#8217;s frame. Most of these early gable-entry barns have no windows under the eaves on the &#8220;northerly&#8221; side (the haymow) since the farmer piled hay high to the rafters\u00a0on this section. Conversely, windows are found on the opposite side to allow some sun in winter for the benefit of the animals.<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #222222;\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p align=\"CENTER\"><span style=\"color: #222222;\"><span style=\"font-family:Georgia, Serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"><b>Barn #6: Hankins Barn<\/b><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p align=\"CENTER\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.otisfield.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/image06.png\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-424\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-424\" src=\"http:\/\/www.otisfield.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/image06-300x225.png\" alt=\"Hankins Barn\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" srcset=\"http:\/\/www.otisfield.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/image06-300x225.png 300w, http:\/\/www.otisfield.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/image06-768x576.png 768w, http:\/\/www.otisfield.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/image06.png 800w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #222222;\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #222222;\"><span style=\"font-family:Georgia, Serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">This early, attached barn is built with beautiful examples of medieval English tying joints. Roman numerals at prominent joint locations testify to the traditional &#8220;scribe rule&#8221; layout and assembly method. Post spacing is fairly close at 10 feet, making for a strong frame. The building has been added on to at the rear and this illustrates the superior ease of the gable-entry barn design in terms of expansion. By simply adding a bent or two at the back of the barn, as this farmer did years ago,\u00a0he simply\u00a0got a longer version of the original layout. Earlier &#8220;English barns&#8221; proved difficult to expand. With a door under the eaves instead of at the gable end, adding to the ends of an English barn will put any addition further and further away from the barn&#8217;s main aisle, hindering serviceability with a horse and wagon, etc.<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #222222;\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #222222;\"><span style=\"font-family:Georgia, Serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">Like all the other barns visited this day, except the Nutting Barn, the Hankins Barn has a purlin roof system with the boarding laid vertically. There is also a low basement area under the &#8220;sunny side&#8221; of the barn testifying to the manure basement phenomenon that became quite popular on New England\u00a0barns. These began showing up in the 1840s. Before this, manure was pitched outdoors where it became eroded and much of it wasted. Early farmers were not well educated on the concept of fertilizer and crop rotation. Early reports tell of farmers using any-and-everything to try and revive their early, worn-out fields. Feathers, hair, and leaves were spread on fields in the beginning. Keeping manure undercover (using scuttles in the cattle tie-up area)\u00a0was soon discovered to be of great benefit and explains why many barns were built on sloping ground. The buildings often start at ground-level at the front,\u00a0while the rear of them is elevated on posts, just like we see with the Hankins Barn today.<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.otisfield.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/image01.png\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-419\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-419\" src=\"http:\/\/www.otisfield.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/image01-225x300.png\" alt=\"Hankins Barn - English Tying Joint\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"http:\/\/www.otisfield.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/image01-225x300.png 225w, http:\/\/www.otisfield.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/image01.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p align=\"CENTER\"><span style=\"color: #222222;\"><span style=\"font-family:Georgia, Serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">English tying joint area, Hankins Barn<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #222222;\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p align=\"CENTER\"><span style=\"color: #222222;\"><span style=\"font-family:Georgia, Serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"><b>Barn #7: Kemp Barn<\/b><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p align=\"CENTER\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.otisfield.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/image00.png\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-418\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-418\" src=\"http:\/\/www.otisfield.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/image00-300x225.png\" alt=\"Kemp Barn\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" srcset=\"http:\/\/www.otisfield.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/image00-300x225.png 300w, http:\/\/www.otisfield.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/image00-768x576.png 768w, http:\/\/www.otisfield.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/image00.png 800w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #222222;\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #222222;\"><span style=\"font-family:Georgia, Serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">This barn is somewhat unique in that it is two barns that were hauled together end-to-end. A double set of posts, tie beams, rafters and bracing testify to this in the building&#8217;s center. Both halves of the barn exhibit hand hewn frames with English tying joints. Joining early barns together happened more often that one would imagine. Teams upon teams of oxen moved these buildings using rollers, or perhaps during winter when the ground was frozen and they slid easier. Thought it could not be determined in the quick visit this day, the two halves could have been early English barns with eaves side-entry doors. Many farmers placed these smaller barns end-to-end to take advantage of the newer and more efficient\u00a0long central aisle concept of the\u00a0&#8220;Yankee&#8221; or &#8220;New England&#8221; gable-entry barn design. With new roofing, siding and a gable entry cut in, many of these joined-together buildings exist among us but we are simply unable to tell from the exterior.<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #222222;\">\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.otisfield.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/image02.png\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-420\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-420\" src=\"http:\/\/www.otisfield.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/image02-225x300.png\" alt=\"Kemp Barn\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"http:\/\/www.otisfield.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/image02-225x300.png 225w, http:\/\/www.otisfield.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/image02.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px\" \/><\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<p align=\"CENTER\"><span style=\"color: #222222;\"><span style=\"font-family:Georgia, Serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">At the building&#8217;s center, two posts means two barns, Kemp<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #222222;\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p align=\"CENTER\"><span style=\"color: #222222;\"><span style=\"font-family:Georgia, Serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"><b>Conclusion<\/b><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #222222;\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #222222;\"><span style=\"font-family:Georgia, Serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">Otisfield has several early 1800&#8217;s barns still standing. Joinery details in these buildings reinforce the English lineage of the area&#8217;s early settlers. None of the barns visited today still housed animals or hay. Instead they have been repurposed to keep lawn tractors and cars, and otherwise provide general storage for their owners. Keeping them in good repair is a challenge for many.<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #222222;\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #222222;\"><span style=\"font-family:Georgia, Serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">Of interest is the 3-foot clapboards found on two of the barns, which could lead to interesting insights with the area&#8217;s sawmills years ago. Another point of mention is the absence of cupolas and fancy trim details on any these barns. Most of them are too old to have been influenced by Victorian design elements (cupolas came around 1850).\u00a0However, perhaps more to the point, these spartan buildings attest to the common farmers that tirelessly worked them.<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #222222;\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #222222;\"><span style=\"font-family:Georgia, Serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">The exception is the\u00a0Nutting Barn.

As a religious body it has continued longer than any other denomination in town. Its building on Rayville road is Otisfield\u2019s oldest church building. Its records and annals show a body of people with the courage to hold steadfast to their beliefs and, over the years, to persevere even in the face of considerable difficulties. Its story demonstrates the willingness of Otisfield\u2019s Baptists to tolerate and cooperate with those of other religious faiths.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When Otisfield was settled in 1773, one of the conditions Massachusetts placed on its founders was that they must build a church for the residents and that the church be not Baptist but Congregationalist. Accordingly the proprietors and first citizens built the first Bell Hill Meetinghouse, constructed between 1795 and 1799, and replaced by the present building, designed by Nathan Nutting, Jr., in 1839.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Massachusetts law, the taxes paid by everyone in town, whether or not they attended the church, went to support the Congregational church and its minister. But not all the people moving into the new town were Congregationalists. Within two years after the new meetinghouse was erected, a number of Methodists and Baptists in Otisfield began petitioning the town for relief from supporting the Congregational Church which they did not attend. State law required that in order to be exempt from such taxes, individuals had to prove they were regularly attending and supporting some other church. Town records contain a number of these petitions and statements. Among those signing petitions were <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the founders of Otisfield\u2019s Baptist Church.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>The Free Will Baptists<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Baptists who began showing up in Otisfield about 1800 were Free Will Baptists. Without doubt, this is the main reason the East Otisfield <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Free Baptist<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Church bears that name. The denomination owes its start to Benjamin Randall, a sailmaker and tailor by profession, who began to preach in the back country of New Hampshire shortly after the American Revolution. He was a controversial figure who rejected what he considered the beliefs of the traditional, or Calvinistic, Baptist Church. In 1780 Randall founded a new kind of Baptist church at Durham, New Hampshire. That church is usually considered the first Free Will Baptist Church in America. Randall\u2019s preaching of a benevolent, Christ-like God attracted many believers in rural New England. Between 1780 and 1810, over 100 Free Will Baptist churches were founded. By 1880, Maine had over 15,000 Free Will Baptists.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The early Free Will Baptists were characterized by their plain dress and humility. Like other Baptists, they rejected infant baptism. Unlike other Baptists, however, they emphasized not formal doctrine but Christian behavior, including pacifism. They were such strong believers in abolitionism that they refused to wear clothes made of cotton because it was produced by slave labor. Tolerant and respectful of the beliefs of others, they rejected the Calvinist principle that man was born evil and that God selected only a few to be saved. Instead they believed in a kindly God who gave all men the <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">free will<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to follow His commandments.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to the petitions and certificates in the town records, as recorded by William Spurr, the first Baptists in town were Daniel Cobb, Chipman Cobb, Napthali Harmon, John Scribner, Jonathan Piper, James Gerrish, Joseph Cate, and Daniel Scribner. In 1802 Zachariah Leach signed himself as \u201cMinister of the Baptist.\u201d By 1804 James McCorson was pastor. Of this early church Spurr writes, \u201cThis early church failed for want of support but was again organized Nov. 16, 1823, by a council convened at the home of the Rev. William G. Cobb.\u201d The reorganized society consisted of Andrew, Jonathan, and Hannah Cobb; Eunice Morse; and Betsy and Nancy Winship. It was this small group who, five years later, joined with the Methodists to construct the present church. This 1828 building has been called, at different times, the union church or the free meetinghouse, terms that signify both a spirit of interfaith cooperation and of Christian liberality. These sentiments are still much in evidence in today\u2019s church.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A second Free Will Baptist Church in the town was organized in South Otisfield in 1858. It seems to have continued until about 1900, with meetings held mostly in the summer. According to Spurr, the church building in South Otisfield gradually deteriorated until it fell down about 1946.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nineteenth-century services at the Free Baptist Church might seem a bit strange to today\u2019s churchgoers. One church historian states that at monthly meetings all members of the church were expected to \u201cspeak of their Christian experience and test their fellowship with each other.\u201d The services included exhortations, confession, prayer, and praise. Each church, like today, had a ruling elder or moderator, a pastor, a deacon, and a clerk. Quarterly meetings were the regional associations which organized individual Free Baptist congregations. By 1895 there were 19 such quarterly meetings in the state of Maine, one of which was held in Otisfield. In that year twelve churches were represented at the Otisfield quarterly meeting.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During the years following the establishment of the Free Will Baptist churches in New England, there was little communication between the Free Will Baptists and the \u201cregular\u201d Baptists, or Calvinistic Baptists, as they were sometimes known. Some New England towns even had two Baptist churches, one of each kind, and both considered themselves the only \u201creal\u201d Baptists. But as time passed, the Free Baptists began to give up their strict rules of personal conduct, while the Calvinistic Baptists relinquished their beliefs in predestination. By 1911 the Baptists of Maine agreed on the fundamental principles of their faith and came together as the United Baptist Convention of Maine. One historian has declared that the union of the two bodies was not \u201can indication of one group\u2019s willingness to tolerate another,\u201d but an affirmation that the views of the Free Will Baptists had become widely accepted by Calvinist Baptists. Most of these united Baptist churches now belong to the American Baptist Convention. Although the Free Will Baptists no longer exist as a distinct organization, the words \u201cfree\u201d and \u201cfree will\u201d continue to prefix the names of many Baptist churches in northern New England. The East Otisfield church is among them. \u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>The Church Building<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Like all churches, the East Otisfield Free Baptist Church is both a group of individuals and a building. While the members of the church provide its vitality and strive to fulfill its mission, the church structure itself symbolizes the congregation\u2019s traditions and the endurance of its faith.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The church building stands today as a remarkable symbol of the successful cooperation between various Protestant denominations in town. For a number of years the Baptists and Methodists met, with the town\u2019s permission, in the Bell Hill meetinghouse at times when the Congregationalists were not using it. By the 1820s the number of non-Congregationalists in town had grown to the point that they needed a church building of their own, which neither the Methodists nor the Baptists could afford. Their solution, as mentioned earlier, was to build a single church where both groups could meet. On August 25, 1827, according to the first clerk\u2019s book of the Free Baptist Church, 41 Otisfield men resolved that it was \u201cof importance to the best interest of [the community] to erect a Meetinghouse&#8230;in the Town of Otisfield near Henry Holden\u2019s.\u201d The new meetinghouse was to \u201cbe free for all Christians of all denominations to meet in for the worship of God agreeable to the dictates of conscience and usual practice of each respective denomination.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This wording, which requires the church to be \u201cfree for all Christians,\u201d is one reason the church\u2019s official name became the East Otisfield <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Free<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Baptist Church. The other reason for the use of the word \u201cfree\u201d is, of course, that it was the home of the Free Baptists. As an historical footnote, it is worth mentioning that for a brief time, a third denomination, the Universalists, shared the church with the Methodists and Baptists.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The new union church was built on land donated by Henry Holden, in the part of East Otisfield originally called Holdenville but later known as Rayville. By 1828-29, when the church was constructed, the population of Otisfield had begun to shift away from Bell Hill, where the first houses, meetinghouse, town common, and general store had been built. The village of Rayville was centered around the outlet of Saturday Pond where David Ray built the town\u2019s first gristmill about 1781. A few years later Ray moved his family there and added a sawmill. During the early years of the union church, the village boasted, besides the mills, a physician, an attorney, a shoemaker, a blacksmith, a grocery store, a carriage shop, and even at one time a milliner\u2019s shop!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The interdenominational building committee of 1828 consisted of Thomas Jackson, Henry Holden, and Otis Fernald. The church was to be 42 feet by 50 feet with posts fourteen feet long. It was to contain 50 pews. A large number of individuals helped construct it. The building\u2019s total cost, $1036, was met by selling pews, the common fundraising method of the time. Samuel Wardwell, for example, paid $24 and received pew no. 11; Stevens Rich paid $25 for pew no. 29. Buying a pew did not mean, of course, that the individual could ever take the pew home, but only that he and his family were entitled to sit in that spot each Sunday.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The trustees later voted to build a fence around the building \u201cexcept the part next the road.\u201d They were finicky about the fence posts which, they specified, were to be at least eight inches wide at the small end and were to be set no more than eight feet apart. They also directed that an altar should be built in front of the pulpit. After the formal dedication of the meetinghouse in January 1829, the trustees voted that the outside of the building should be painted white and the doors and fans green.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No pictures survive of that original structure, but we know that by 1866 the building had fallen into disrepair. Town historian<\/span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">William Spurr states that \u201cthe walls began to spread.\u201d By this date, the Universalists, never very numerous, seem to have disappeared from town. And the Methodists, some of whom were now attending the new Methodist Church in Bolster\u2019s Mills, apparently relinquished their share of the meetinghouse to the Baptists. A new committee\u2013this one all Baptists\u2013was appointed to recommend changes: Otis Fernald, James L. Holden, Benjamin T. Holden, Eliphalet Wight, and Henry Holden, Jr. Some drastic modifications were in order. The building was narrowed to thirty-six feet. Posts were \u201cto be raised from twelve inches to twenty-four inches above the top of the plate, with a recess panel in the center of the ceiling overhead.\u201d The pulpit was now moved to the north end and the pews turned to face it. The floor was levelled. The gallery (or balcony) was removed. The \u201csinging seats\u201d for the choir were placed behind the outside doors and elevated to the same height as the pulpit platform.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There were still more alterations. The committee specified three windows on each side of the building<\/span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and two in each end, \u201call to be finished \u201csettee fashion, with modern style and pediment end,\u201d and the pew doors were \u00a0removed. Most of the other furniture in the old building was sold. Once again, individuals were called on to purchase the newly refurbished pews in order to finance the building costs.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By the following year, the church\u2019s structural changes were complete and the meetinghouse assumed the basic simple design it still bears more than 140 years later. Over the years more modifications have been made in the building\u2019s interior. Before central heating was installed, two wood stoves sufficed to heat the church. Electric lights were installed in the 1930s and an oil furnace in the 1940s. A new vestry and kitchen were dedicated in 1962 with a bathroom installed in 1972. The ceiling was lowered in 1973. In many cases, it was the church members themselves who did the work. When central heating was introduced, the Rev. William Dunstan himself built the chimney.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The interior of the church has changed in keeping with the stylistic preferences on the times, not to mention changing notions of economy. Some members still remember the old church carpeting with its big red roses. They can describe, with some delight, the bonfire which years later burned the old rug and its roses after new carpeting was installed. Others rmember the pink paint applied to the church\u2019s interior walls in the 1940s, when Bill Dunstan discovered it was the cheapest color available. After a long period of pink walls, the Circle ladies paid to cover the pink with a neutral beige, to the satisfaction of many.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By 1998 it was clear that the vestry room, kitchen, and storage areas added onto the church from time to time were no longer adequate. The church undertook a successful campaign to raise funds to renovate and expand the old vestry area and to provide, among other things, a new study for the pastor. The church and vestry were reroofed. Two handicapped-accessible bathrooms were created; the kitchen was moved and remodeled; the furnace moved to a lower level; and new storage space created.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And in 2008, following the death of the Rev. Gertrude DeCoteau, pastor of the church for 24 years, the congregation commissioned a stained glass window, placed in the middle front window of the church, to commemorate her many years as faithful church shepherd. \u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>Church Activities and Social Groups<\/b><\/p>\n<p>The musical ministry of the church has always been<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">an important part of the worship service. Early Baptists sang praises to God even before they acquired any means of instrumental accompaniment. The old records do not tell us much about the church\u2019s first organs or those who played them. To the best of anyone\u2019s memory, there have been only four organs. The first, which now keeps dignified silence in the rear of the church, produced music by foot power. The second was an electric organ, purchased in 1960 and replaced in 1970 by an electric Hammond organ. In 1996, a successful fundraising campaign resulted in the purchase of an electronic Technics keyboard more appropriate for some choral arrangements. The names of the earliest organists are not known. In later years, Ethel Hirst and Pearl Peaco were noted not just for their musical skills but for their many years of devoted service. For a number of years Mrs. Hirst directed a small choir. Since about 1980, Priscilla Delehanty has served as organist.Since 1994 she has directed an enthusiastic choir of a dozen members whose combined voices glorify God each Sunday. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to its importance as a regional center for Free Will Baptists, the church in East Otisfield has always been important as a community center. During most of the nineteenth century it was known as \u201cthe lower meetinghouse\u201d to distinguish it from the \u201cupper meetinghouse,\u201d that is, the Congregational Church on Bell Hill. Otisfield resident Pliny Henley, a Congregationalist, wrote in his diary on December 25, 1871, that he \u201cwent to a Christmas entertainment\u201d at the lower house, meaning the Baptist Church at Rayville.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Throughout the years, the church has sponsored a number of groups, most of which grew out of a common desire for fellowship, sociability, Christian education, moral improvement, or philanthropy. Until the vestry or fellowship room was completed in 1962, all such church groups met in members\u2019 homes or in the Otisfield Community Hall. Today we have only scanty records and little memory of the Missionary Society, Junior Girls Society, World Wide Guild, Children\u2019s World Crusade, Junior Church Group, and Vacation Bible School. Of the Sunshine Society, we know only that it was a ladies social group, organized about 1910. And we know that about 1982 the Reverend George Wardwell was instrumental in forming a large youth group which flourished for a number of years.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By far the oldest and longest lasting organization affiliated with the church was the Ladies Circle, which until recently was an important group in both church and community. Just when the Circle was first organized is not clear, but it certainly existed in 1892 and probably long before that date. Its goal was mostly philanthropic. In 1930, for example, the Circle purchased 53 new hymnals for the church; later it paid for the installation of electric lights in the church parsonage. At first the women met in each others\u2019 homes or in the Community Hall but in later years in the church vestry. During one period the Circle ladies seem to have had literary ambitions. Every other week in 1892 they wrote and read essays and poems on morally uplifting topics. Some of these literary gems still repose among the church records. In more recent years more of the Circle\u2019s time was devoted to sewing aprons and quilts, constructing Christmas wreaths, and making other items for their annual sale. One long-term church member recently commented that during the church\u2019s financially difficult periods, it was largely the Circle\u2019s financial help which kept the church afloat.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Today the major church organization is the Scholarship Committee. Inspired and led by the Reverend DeCoteau and Marion Culbert, since about 1985 members of this group have raised money throughout the years with such activities as craft fairs, flea markets, and the sale of popcorn balls at Christmas, all making it possible for the church to award annual college scholarships to deserving young people.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the last Sunday in August each year, the church sponsors an unusual event, the Joe Holden Picnic, which never fails to draw the interest of local newspaper reporters. In 1900 Joe Holden, a local mill owner who had gained wide notoriety for his view that the earth is flat, bequeathed a fund for an annual Sunday School picnic. In 1977 William S. Spurr, the town historian, further supported the picnic by his bequest of \u00a0a sum for strawberry ice cream, popcorn, and peanuts to be served.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">About 2008 interim minister Danford Carr (2007-09) was the force behind a new venture for the church, a series of \u00a0free suppers. These \u201cGetting to Know You\u201d suppers have proved a popular \u2013 and delicious \u2013 new means of introducing the church to others in the community. \u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In recent years the church has demonstrated its social commitment and its willingness to practice what it preaches outside the walls of the church and beyond the bounds of the town. For several years the church has hosted a successful picnic for residents of Oxford Hills nursing homes, now held at the Otisfield Community Hall. Moving even farther afield, beginning about 1988 the Otisfield Baptists have sent aid and several of its members to join individuals from many other churches to help build a church and hospital at La Romana in the Dominican Republic. Their experiences as overseas missionaries have helped La Romana physically and materially and have spiritually enriched the Otisfield church. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Then in 2002, \u00a0responding to a plea from Henry Hamilton, then doing relief work in Afghanistan, church members dipped into their wallets and provided enough funding to dig two new wells, one at a clinic for women and children which previously had lacked water altogether. The delighted Henry sent back photos of the wells, including signs which read \u00a0\u201cGift of the East Otisfield Free Baptist Church, Otisfield, Maine.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>Ups and Downs<\/b><\/p>\n<p>In 1840, just twelve years after the Baptists and Methodists built the union church in East Otisfield, the town\u2019s population peaked at 1307, a mark not surpassed until late in the twentieth century. In 1840 the village of Rayville was a busy place, with a number of small industries providing employment, income, and amenities for the families of the area. After this time, however, better opportunities for farming in the Midwest and for industries in the developing cities slowly but steadily depleted Otisfield\u2019s population. The exodus of people from town contributed to a decline in church membership which was not reversed until well after World War II.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Looking backwards, it appears that one of the church\u2019s high points may have been from about 1866-1880. Unfortunately, we have no membership or attendance records for this period. But the church must have been in a flourishing state, because in 1866, just after the end of the Civil War, the Baptists were able to afford the substantial remodeling of the church building. Church attendance was probably high. The late 1800s witnessed intermittent religious revivals which periodically swept new members into the churches. During one such revival in 1878, Otisfield farmer Albert Kemp (1832-1883) kept a journal of his own spiritual awakening and that of his wife Sarah which gives us a sense of the church\u2019s strength. Nearly every day for over a month the Kemps attended religious meetings at the Baptist church, at members\u2019 homes, and at the Wardwellville schoolhouse. On November 11, Albert wrote that his burden was finally lifted, that he \u201creceived a free pardon\u201d of his sins. On December 20, the couple were baptized in the cold water of Saturday Pond. He recorded the event: \u201cRepaired to the water, it snowed quite fast. Elder Johnson baptized wife and myself and we received a great blessing.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The vitality of the church can be measured in another way, by number of formal members. In 1884, the first year for which figures are available, membership of the East Otisfield Free Baptist Church was a robust 72. But as the town\u2019s population fell to 581 in 1920, the church\u2019s members also dwindled, down to 41 in 1926, perhaps the all-time low water mark. Some remember Sundays when only six or eight people attended services. On some occasions the church treasurer had to dip into her own money to pay the pastor\u2019s weekly salary. Attendance was often better in the summer, especially during the years when the boys from Great Oaks Camp walked down to the church and filled up the first four rows of the center section.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even though the church\u2019s resources were limited, ministers had to be paid and the church building heated and maintained. The Otisfield Baptists found some new ways to manage. From 1926 to 1930, the Baptists and the Congregationalists at Spurr\u2019s Corners held joint services during the summer at the Bell Hill meetinghouse, which the Congregationalists had stopped using in 1887 in favor of the newer church at Spurr\u2019s Corner, dedicated in 1871. During the spring and fall from 1926 to 1930 the Baptists continued to meet in their own building; in the winter they met at the Community Hall in East Otisfield, presumably to save on heating costs. And at other times before Rayville road was paved, the Baptists met at the Community Hall in order to avoid the mud on Rayville Road. In 1930 the Congregational and Baptist Churches of Otisfield united to form the Lake Thompson United Parish, a union that lasted until 1934.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A new era in inter-church cooperation began in 1943 when the East Otisfield Baptist Church and the Oxford Congregational Church inaugurated a long era of cooperative ministry. For thirty-six years, until 1979, the two churches supported a single minister to serve both churches. Some of the seven pastors who served the joint ministry in this period were Congregationalist; some were Baptist. This cooperative arrangement meant that the Sunday services had to be timed very strictly. One Otisfield oldtimer remembers, for example, that the Baptist services were never more than forty-five minutes long, because immediately after the last word of the benediction, the pastor had to rush off to minister to the Congregationalists in Oxford.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once the joint ministry ended, it was difficult to find a pastor who would stay more than two or three years with \u00a0the salary the small church could afford. Yet in 1984 the Reverend Gertrude DeCoteau was installed as church pastor, a position she held successfully until her death in 2007. A vital and beloved part of the community as well as the church, she left the church in a position far stronger than it had been at the start of her ministry.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gertrude\u2019s sudden passing left the church with an immediate and crucial problem, that of finding someone to fill the pulpit and lead the church until a new pastor could be found. Once again the Otisfield Baptists proved their mettle. The church officers and deacons especially stepped up to the task, \u00a0led by Patricia Dyer Haggerty who served as lay preacher for \u00a0many months before and after Gertrude\u2019s death. The church was also most fortunate to have the services from 2007 to 2009 of the Reverend Danford Carr and his wife, Janet. Dan quickly filled the emotional vacuum left by Gertrude\u2019s absence. Together he and Jan spread the message of hope and renewal so necessary for a congregation in transition.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The last seventy-five years, including the last of the twentieth century and the start of the twenty-first, have meant more changes in American society, the town, and the church. One of the biggest changes is that the town\u2019s population has climbed well over the level it reached about 1840 and now is close to the two thousand mark. Another change, the spread of the automobile, has made the trip to church, and other places, faster and easier. At the same time, the population of Otisfield, like that of America as a whole, is far more diverse. Women have left the home to become better educated and to provide more resources for their families. As the twenty-first century develops, we find not only that there are more churches competing for worshippers on Sunday, but also that more secular and recreational activities compete with the churches.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All these changes have produced an East Otisfield Free Baptist Church which differs considerably from the one where our predecessors worshipped. It is hard now to imagine how anyone today would even notice, much less comment, as they did in 1945, on the fact that the new minister\u2019s wife was not wearing a hat! In 1984, nearly forty years after this early demonstration of feminine independence, the installation of the Reverend Gertrude DeCoteau as the church\u2019s first woman pastor signalled a change not just in church leadership but in society as a whole. And doubtless our ancestors would have not understood the ecumenical spirit exemplified by the singing of a Jewish rabbi at the installation service for \u00a0her successor, the \u00a0Reverend Genise Knowlton, in 2009. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Just as important was the growth in church membership \u00a0during the Reverend DeCoteau\u2019s tenure. By 2010, the number of formal members had risen from a low of 41 in 1926 to about 100. That figure is close to a record high. Perhaps an even more important change is in the composition of the congregation. Through the World War II period, transportation difficulties meant that nearly all those attending lived in Otisfield, especially East Otisfield, but the congregation now includes those who walk to church as well as those who drive from Casco, Oxford, and Norway.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the same time, the Free Baptist Church has continued to follow the liberal tradition of the early Free Will Baptists who preached the possibility of universal salvation and followed the practice of open communion. Tolerance for those of other faiths has resulted in the fact that today\u2019s congregation embraces those of diverse religious backgrounds.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Through the ages all the Baptists of Otisfield have sung God\u2019s praises, beginning back in the days when the town was part of Massachusetts and they needed written permission to worship as Baptists. The simple white church building in Rayville, built by Methodists and Baptists together, now belongs only to the Baptists, but, now as then, welcomes churchgoers of all faiths. As in the days gone by, the East Otisfield Free Baptist Church continues to represent a spirit of tolerance and of religious cooperation, a proud part both of community and of the world of Christ. \u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">+ \u00a0+ \u00a0+ \u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sources for this history include William S.

The most obvious changes were technological. In 1903 the Oxford and Otisfield Telephone Company began constructing the first telephone lines in town. In 1909, Nellie Pottle and her classmates saw their first automobile, driven by Dr.Orin Stevens of Oxford, come chugging past Pugleyville School. By 1926 there was enough automobile traffic to prompt the town to replace its snow roller with a truck-driven plow. During the 1930s, lines bearing electric power spread through the town, brightening lives and lightening everyone\u2019s workload.<\/p>\n<p>Other changes were more subtle, particularly the change in how people in Otisfield earned a living.Starting in the second part of the nineteenth century, Otisfield, like other southern Maine towns, suffered a steady decline in agricultural production and income. So many left for better opportunities in the Midwest that the population of Maine\u2019s cities and towns fell precipitously. Otisfield was no exception. From a peak of 1,307 in 1840 the population declined over a hundred years to only 488 in 1940. It may have been coincidental that the town\u2019s poor farm, first opened in 1865, shut down in 1924 partly because it had no residents.<\/p>\n<p>From 1910 to 1920 especially, a considerable number of families of Finnish background arrived in town, in many cases buying up the old farms which the earlier settlers had given up on. Hard-working families named Heikkinen, Tikkanen, and Jaakkola settled on Bell Hill. They brought not only new blood into town but also new customs, traditions, and such novelties as saunas and skis. At the end of the twentieth century, the Finnish heritage remains an important element in Otisfield.<\/p>\n<p>About 1920, at the same time that sawmills and farming were waning, the advent of the automobile helped create new opportunities for profit making\u2014\u2014\u2014tourism and real estate. A number of children\u2019s camps opened on Otisfield\u2019s three major lakes: Ohuivo, Wacipi Pines, and Wayaka on Thompson Lake; Great Oaks on Saturday Pond; Powhatan, Truda, and Arcadia on Pleasant Pond. The camps flourished from 1925 into the 1960s. Most now have been closed and sold off as individual building lots. Arcadia, however, continues to flourish, and Powhatan has gained a new life as Seeds of Peace Camp. The rapid development of shore property for summer cottages and second homes, begun in the 1920s and 30s, continues unabated today.<\/p>\n<p>World War II served as a watershed for Otisfield. During the war many young people from town served in the armed forces, some never to return. Others found work in Maine\u2019s booming shipyards. Since 1945 the town\u2019s population has turned around and shown steady growth, rising to 1,136 by 1990. Modern roads and automobiles have allowed residents to take advantage of country living while commuting to neighboring towns and cities for work. Otisfield is no longer a farming community; on the other hand, it has maintained a strong rural character. Since World War II particularly, the town has attracted not just vacationing visitors but individuals and families who enjoy outdoor activities, hunting in the fall, snowmobiling and ice fishing in the winter, and water sports in the summer.<\/p>\n<p>As the twentieth century is about to give way to the twenty-first, Otisfield is no longer the wilderness that George Peirce found in 1775. Neither is it any more the collection of distinct villages that it was in the last century. Industry has moved out of town, leaving Otisfield without a post office or business center except for the one small year~round store in Bolsters Mills. On the other hand, technological changes and changes in the town\u2019s population and economy have tended to unify the town and lend it a singular character. Newcomers to the town still remark, with pleasure, about one aspect of Otisfield that has remained the same for two centuries, its form of government. Otisfield citizens still gather together at a town meeting every spring to elect three selectmen and to conduct the town\u2019s business, just as they first did in May of 1787. One recent political change shows how seriously Otisfielders take their political responsibilities. In 1978, led by Albert Willis, the townspeople staged a rebellion possibly inspired by America\u2019s revolt from England two centuries before. Otisfield objected to being taxed to pay for Cumberland County\u2019s new civic center in Portland. It was, they felt, simply a device on Portland\u2019s part to pass the tax burden on to towns which would not benefit. Richard Bean flatly declared, \u201cWe will secede.\u201d And so they did. Eventually, with the blessing of Oxford County, the Maine legislature passed an act enabling Otisfield to withdraw from Cumberland and join Oxford County. Otisfield\u2019s victory was complete.<\/p>\n<p>Doubtless more great events of this kind will occur in the twenty-first century, transforming Otisfield in ways we cannot even guess. Whatever these changes are, let us hope that the town will always remember its history. It is Otisfield\u2019s past, after all, that is responsible for what it is today. A small town with pride in its natural surroundings, its relaxed way of life, and its tradition of independence. George Peirce would approve of what has become of his wilderness.<\/p>\n<p><strong>lnformation Sources <\/strong><br \/>\n<em>Centennial History of Harrison<\/em> (1905); Ioan C.

Each village by modern standards was relatively isolated from the others; each had its own particular character. Otisfield\u2019s population increased rapidly after 1800. Soon the communities already established at Edes Falls and on Bell Hill were supplemented by such settlements as Jugtown, Wardwellville, Hancockville, Dunkertown, and Swampville. Though these names are not often used today, during most of Otisfield\u2019s history they denoted separate villages. Today a few of these places retain their nineteenth century names and vestiges of that village character.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Spurrs\u2019s Corner<\/strong> was named for one of Otisfield\u2019s first settlers, Enoch Spurr, a Revolutionary War veteran and the first town clerk. Perhaps because of its good road access to Edes Falls, the village developed into a town center. Otisfield\u2019s second school district included Spurr\u2019s Corner. A general store opened by 1838. In the 1850s the Spurr family was operating a nearby shingle mill. During the Civil War, a clothing manufacturing business was established, and a large tin shop was set up in 1868. Although these early mills and factories were gone by 1900, as late as the 1950s Glenn C. Henry, an inventor and engineer, sometimes called \u201cthe folding man,\u201d ran a small shop which produced collapsible record albums, notebooks, and even folding boats. In 1887, as the town\u2019s population shifted away from Bell Hill, the Congregationalists moved their regular services from the Bell Hill meetinghouse into a church built in 1871 at Spurr\u2019s Corner. The Otisfield Grange was first organized here in 1875 with forty charter members and E. Sylvester as first master. This Grange closed in 1959.<\/p>\n<p><strong>East Otisfield.<\/strong> In the eastern part of town the Sucker Brook flows from the outlet of Saturday Pond to Thompson Lake. Along its course two important mill sites developed, and two villages sprang up, known as Rayville and Pugleyville.<\/p>\n<p>In 1783 David Ray moved his family by ox sled from road\u2019s end at the Patch house on Bell Hill through the woods to the outlet of Saturday Pond. There he built the first grist mill and sawmill within the bounds of present day Otisfield. The cluster of dwellings, school, and church that grew up around the mills came to be known as Rayville. Ray was one of early Otisfield\u2019s most important citizens. He was the town\u2019s first physician. He opened his own school some years before the first town school was built on Bell Hill. He was also elected moderator for the first town meeting. After the Civil War Joseph W. Holden rebuilt Ray\u2019s mill and operated it until 1890. David Ray\u2019s house and the remains of the granite dam that once powered his mills still stand in Rayville.<\/p>\n<p>Another important part of Rayville was its early church. In 1829 the town\u2019s Baptists and Methodists jointly constructed a Union Church, the same church that now serves as the East Otisfield Free Baptist Church.<\/p>\n<p>Probably the best known citizen of Rayville is Joseph W. Holden (1815-1900), mill owner and later prominent member of the Flat Earth Society. Because Joe Holden willed a small sum in support of a Sunday School picnic, East Otisfield still celebrates a Joe Holden Day each summer, honoring \u201cthe old astronomer\u201d who, as the inscription of his gravestone tells, \u201cdiscovered that the Earth is flat and stationary, and that the sun and moon do move.\u201d In 1977, Otisfield native William Spurr also left money for the picnic. Spurr\u2019s bequest stipulated that strawberry ice cream must be served.<\/p>\n<p>The origin of the name \u201cPugleyville\u201d is uncertain. Historian William Spurr\u2019s explanation is that \u201cpuggling around,\u201d meaning fussing around, was the favorite expression of one village lady named Mrs. Samuel Edgley. Another theory is that the village was named for an early family named Pugley. Like the other town centers, Pugleyville had a number of early industries. Until 1846 George W. Barrows operated a tannery and made shoes and boots there. The mills built in 1812 by Timothy Fernald on Sucker Brook near Thompson Pond were operated by a succession of individuals, the last of whom were the Kemp Brothers, who closed down in the 1930s. Early in the twentieth century, Harry M. Stone operated a small shop in Pugleyville for canning apples, vegetables, and jellies. Since 1865, at least, when Zachariah Wardwell opened his store, the village had a retail store. In the twentieth century a number of individuals owned and operated the East Otisfield General Store, including Ellis R. Stone, Chester Lamb, and David Bean. After the store finally closed about 1960, the building was torn down.<\/p>\n<p>Through the nineteenth century Rayville and Pugleyville each had a one room school. In fact, the school system, based on the premise that children could walk as much as a mile and a half to school, at one time included fourteen school districts, each with a one room school. Once automobiles became established, the district school system ended. Otisfield\u2019s first consolidated school was opened in 1950 in East Otisfield, after the economically minded townspeople moved the old Spurr\u2019s Corner schoolhouse north a few miles and joined it to the one room school in East Otisfield. The last step in the consolidation process was the opening in 1990 of the Otisfield Community School, serving grades K-6, on the Powhatan Road. In 1992 the building in East Otisfield which had served as the town\u2019s elementary school for over forty years became the Otisfield Town Office. Since 1966 Otisfield has been part of School Administrative District 17, along with seven other towns, and students in grades 7\u201412 attend the Oxford Hills Middle and Senior High Schools.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Bolsters Mills<\/strong>, first known as Pinhook, was named for Isaac Bolster (1769-1835). Although originally Otisfield\u2019s boundaries included both sides of the Crooked River, in 1805 the river became the line between Otisfield and the new town of Harrison. Today Bolsters Mills remains a distinct village within the two towns, with its own traditions, such as a Bolsters Mills Day, which ignore town boundaries. It is also a matter of local pride that Bolsters Mills has recorded some of the lowest daily temperatures in Maine, on occasion even in the United States. But its first settlers were doubtless drawn by the possibilities of water power. Over the years, seven mills were built here. In 1819 Isaac Bolster built a dam, saw mill, and gristmill on the east side of the Crooked River.William Bolster later built a fulling mill on the Harrison side of the river, where later a district school, Methodist Church, Grange hall, and public library were also located. About 1920 Fred Clark closed down the last mill in the village.<\/p>\n<p>Isaac Bolster, Jr., built a general store on the Otisfield side of the river in 1821. The store, which once also served as post office, has been in continuous operation ever since, operated in the twentieth century by (among others) Lawrence and Rose Spiller, Albert and Nellie Hamlin, James and Judy Colburn, and David Dale. In 1997 it was the only store in Otisfield open year-round.<\/p>\n<p><strong>South Otisfield<\/strong> which includes the Mayberry Ridge overlooking Pleasant Pond, was once called Dunkertown, perhaps a corruption of \u201cDonkeytown.\u201d Today it is a residential area which, except for its cemetery, bears few obvious signs of its industrial past. But about 1900, in addition to its school and Baptist church, Dunkertown featured Forrest Edwards\u2019 apple orchard and Ephraim B. Jillson\u2019s cornshop, established in 1890 and operating until about 1925. The cornshop probably constituted Otisfield\u2019s largest commercial business.<\/p>\n<p><strong>The Gore<\/strong> began its history as Phillips Gore, named for Samuel Phillips, an early owner of the land. It began its existence as a rectangle of unincorporated territory that fell between the surveyed boundaries of adjacent towns, in this case between Otisfield and Oxford. Otisfield annexed the Gore in 1803. The area was settled early and was distinguished by a number of large farms, including those belonging to the Sawyer, Lombard and \u00a0moving into the twentieth century, the Linnell, Brett, and Thomas families. The Frederick Robie Grange, organized in 1890, served as a social center for the Gore until it merged with Oxford in 1997. The Gore school, because of its distance from the Otisfield Central School, continued in use well after the closing of the town\u2019s other one-room schools.<\/p>\n"},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>From A Short History of Otisfield By Jean &amp; David Hankins During the first decades of the nineteenth century, when transportation moved no faster than a horse could walk, when communication was either by word of mouth or a note delivered across town by a friend or neighbor, Otisfield\u2019s wilderness evolved into an agricultural society [&hellip;]<\/p>\n"},"author":1,"featured_image":95,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"format":"standard","media":{"id":"95","url":"http:\/\/www.otisfield.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/01\/E.-Otisfield-corn-shop-2.jpg","width":1500,"height":1000,"thumbnail":{"url":"http:\/\/www.otisfield.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/01\/E.-Otisfield-corn-shop-2-150x150.jpg","width":150,"height":150}},"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/www.otisfield.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/218"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/www.otisfield.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/www.otisfield.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/www.otisfield.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/www.otisfield.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=218"}],"version-history":[{"href":"http:\/\/www.otisfield.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/218\/revisions"}],"https:\/\/api.w.org\/featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/www.otisfield.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/95"}],"https:\/\/api.w.org\/attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/www.otisfield.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=218"}],"https:\/\/api.w.org\/term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/www.otisfield.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/218\/categories"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/www.otisfield.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/218\/tags"}],"https:\/\/api.w.org\/meta":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/www.otisfield.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/218\/meta"}]}},{"id":216,"date":"2015-03-19T22:48:31","date_gmt":"2015-03-19T22:48:31","guid":{"rendered":"http:\/\/www.otisfield.org\/?p=216"},"modified":"2015-03-20T00:28:27","modified_gmt":"2015-03-20T00:28:27","slug":"eighteenth-century-beginnings","type":"post","link":"http:\/\/www.otisfield.org\/2015\/03\/19\/eighteenth-century-beginnings\/","title":{"rendered":"Eighteenth Century: Beginnings"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>From\u00a0<em>A Short History of Otisfield<\/em><\/p>\n<p>By Jean &amp; David Hankins<\/p>\n<p>When in 1775 George Peirce arrived in the land northeast of Sebago Lake, he found hills, lakes, streams, but no people. For centuries the land that is now Otisfield had been traversed by Passamaquoddy Indians on foot and in canoes, but no archaeological evidence exists of any permanent human settlement before Peirce\u2019s arrival. Peirce, the agent of a group of Boston based businessmen, had a specific commission. From what was essentially an untouched wilderness, he was to build a town. He was to run a town\u2019s boundaries and divide the land within those bounds into hundred acre lots, thus allowing for individual ownership. He was to clear a road and build a bridge over the Crooked River to allow access to those lots. On the river he was to construct a saw mill and grist mill. In short, Peirce was commissioned to establish the structure that would allow a new town to take root in the western hills of the Massachusetts territory of Maine.<\/p>\n<p>Otisfield\u2019s beginnings actually reach back close to a hundred years before George Peirce\u2019s arrival. Otisfield became one of many so called \u201cCanada towns,\u201d towns tracing their origin to 1690 when Massachusetts sponsored an unsuccessful military expedition against French held Canada. In 1736 the Massachusetts General Court had actually granted a township to the heirs and descendants of the military company headed by Captain John Gorham which participated in that expedition. For various reasons that land grant was cancelled and in 1771 superseded by a second grant of land to the heirs of Gorham\u2019s Company. Twenty Boston businessmen, most of whom had no connection to the original grantees, acquired rights to the land and became its proprietors.In 1776, presumably to honor Col. James Otis, one of the major property holders, the proprietors voted to name their town Otis Field. At their bidding, George Peirce arrived in Edes Falls (now part of Naples), and set to work establishing the new town.<\/p>\n<p>Eighteenth century Otisfield encompassed a much larger area than it does now. Bounded by Raymondtown and Bridgetown, the new town eventually would be the northernmost town in Cumberland County. Its western boundry included the eastern half of what is now Harrison. (Harrison was established in 1805 by setting off the land east of Long Lake and west of the Crooked River from Bridgton and Otisfield.) To the southwest the town extended from Edes Falls across the outlet of Long Lake to include much of what is now the village of Naples. (Naples was formed in 1834 from parts of Otisfield, Raymond, Harrison, Sebago, and Bridgton.)<\/p>\n<p>George Peirce chose Edes Falls for his foothold in this wilderness first, because of the water power supplied by the falls on the Crooked River, and second, because of the ease of access to more developed towns to the south by way of the Crooked and Songo Rivers and Sebago Lake. One of Peirce\u2019s conditions for undertaking this task was the use of the proprietors\u2019 boat for ten years.<\/p>\n<p>The aim of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts in establishing new towns was to expand settlement, thus increasing trade, security, and the wealth of the colony. Therefore the General Court imposed certain conditions on the proprietors. They could not simply strip their land of virgin timber and abandon it. To retain their grant, within six years the proprietors were to settle thirty families, build a meetinghouse, and settle a \u201cLearned Protestant Minister\u201d in town.<\/p>\n<p>The town\u2019s second settler, Benjamin Patch, arrived in 1776 from Groton, married George Peirce\u2019s daughter Sarah, and soon moved onto Bell Hill, where his son Levi built what is now thought to be Otisfield\u2019s oldest house. Despite the outbreak of the American Revolution, more new settlers continued to arrive, principally from Wrentham and Groton, in Massachusetts, and from Gorham and Falmouth in what is today Maine. By 1783 fourteen families had purchased hundred acre lots from the proprietors, clearing land, building log homes, and producing large families. They were the families headed by George Peirce, Benjamin Patch, Ebenezer Kemp, Joseph Spurr, Daniel Cobb, Samuel and Micah Whitney, Jonathan Moors, David Ray, Mark and Zebulon Knight, Jonathan Britton, Samuel Reed, and David Mayberry.<\/p>\n<p>Edes Falls, with its access to Long Lake and the Songo River and with water power for Peirce\u2019s mills, was the first part of the original Otisfield to be settled. From there settlement spread to the north and east. Perhaps because of its longer growing season, Bell Hill was the earliest settled section of present-day Otisfield. Bell Hill, originally known simply as \u201cOtisfield Hill,\u201d was also the location for the town\u2019s first school district and the first town school, built in 1800. It was also Bell Hill that the proprietors selected as a site for the meetinghouse they commissioned George Peirce to build. That meeting house was dedicated on November 7, 1797. The proprietors\u2019 gift of half a barrel of New England rum and half a barrel of West Indies rum made the dedication ceremony a bit merrier. Two weeks later eight men and women \u2014 one Peirce, three Spurrs, two Hancocks, one Turner, and one Thurston \u2014formally covenanted together to form the Otisfield Congregational Church, with the Rev. Thomas Roby as the first minister. In 1839 the present Bell Hill Meetinghouse, designed by Nathan Nutting, ]r., was erected.<\/p>\n<p>Through these early years, as the first settlers struggled to carve their farms from the forests, they looked to the proprietors for the necessities of a civilized town\u2014roads, bridges, schools, and churches. The proprietors, after all, owned the town. The townspeople were increasingly dissatis\ufb01ed with a system where decisions were made by absentee landlords in Boston, where months, often years would pass before their requests were answered. As the settlers gained control of the land, they also sought to gain control of its governance. In 1787 the residents successfully petitioned the Commonwealth of Massachusetts to gain the status of plantation. The first plantation meeting, the precursor of our present-day town meeting, was held on May 18, at the house of Deacon Stephen Phinney, with David Ray acting as moderator. Eleven years later, on February 19, 1798, the General Court of Massachusetts passed an \u201cAct to incorporate the Plantation called Otisfield, in the County of Cumberland, into a Town by the name of Otisfield.\u201d With the town\u2019s incorporation, the proprietary role of the Boston businessmen came to an end. The residents of Otisfield had now to look after their own affairs.<\/p>\n"},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>From\u00a0A Short History of Otisfield By Jean &amp; David Hankins When in 1775 George Peirce arrived in the land northeast of Sebago Lake, he found hills, lakes, streams, but no people.
